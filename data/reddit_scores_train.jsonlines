{"title":"Post viral cough: why does it get worse after you get better?","full_text":"Post viral cough: why does it get worse after you get better? Tl;dr: why is your cough during an upper respiratory infection not as bad as your post viral cough? (In the absence of asthma or secondary infection)\n\nHey folks! This question is perplexing me and I can\u2019t seem to find a specific answer via google.\n\nI think I understand why post viral cough happens in the first place: Your mucosa are already inflamed from the infection and immune response. Your cough reflex is hypersensitive because it kicked into gear to fight the virus. As such, the smallest irritations (such as post nasal drip or cold air) are far more likely to trigger a cough. This takes a while to calm down. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is the severity and duration. Post viral coughs can take way longer to clear than the virus or any other symptoms. And people often complain of their post viral cough being more frequent, dry, painful and disruptive than when they were sick.\n\nThis has been my experience at least. Sometimes I have a cold and barely cough at all. Then as soon as my nose clears up, coughing fits keep me awake at night for 2 weeks. (And I have no comorbidities or secondary infections.) \n\nSo what\u2019s going on there? Is there like an inflammation cycle? Are my observations totally off?\n\n\u2014 \nEDIT: Thanks so much for these responses! I want to clarify for people requesting\/dispensing medical advice: please don\u2019t! It\u2019s against the rules of the sub. My question is *only* about the irritating unpleasant cough that 1) happens after mild illness 2) your doctor tells you not to worry about and 3) goes away on its own.","score":7.2034055211}

{"title":"Black Lives Matter","full_text":"Black Lives Matter **Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. \n\nWhen 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.\n\nWhen black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.\n\nThese disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. \n\nChange requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. \n\nHowever, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.\n\nThese numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.\n\nThis lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.\n\nIt is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change. \n\n-----\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/116\/34\/16793\n- https:\/\/mappingpoliceviolence.org\/\n- https:\/\/labblog.uofmhealth.org\/rounds\/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19\n- https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK24693\/\n- https:\/\/www.joincampaignzero.org\/research\n- https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2020\/apr\/16\/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19\n- https:\/\/www.npr.org\/transcripts\/867466515\n- https:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2018\/01\/09\/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs\/\n- https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41561-019-0519-z\n- https:\/\/physicstoday.scitation.org\/do\/10.1063\/PT.6.3.20190529a\/full\/\n- https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/outlook\/2018\/09\/11\/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand\/\n- http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/articles\/2017\/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity\/","score":10.8576134227}

In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. \n\nI realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?\n\nAn educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**. Depending on the definition of \"educational divide\" and high-quality data available, such divide might potentially be underway.","score":9.99341966}

{"title":"Gravitational Wave Megathread","full_text":"Gravitational Wave Megathread Hi everyone! We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST \/ 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http:\/\/www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!\n\n-----\n\nLinks:\n\n* [YouTube Announcement](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c7293kAiPZw)\n* [LIGO](http:\/\/www.ligo.org\/news\/media-advisory.php)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by Discovery](http:\/\/news.discovery.com\/space\/what-you-need-to-know-about-gravitational-waves-160210.htm)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics](http:\/\/www.phdcomics.com\/comics.php?f=1853)\n\n-----\n\nFAQ:\n\n> Where do they come from?\n\nThe source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). \n\n> How fast do they go?\n\nGravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Speed_of_gravity)).\n\n> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?\n\nThe 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PSR_B1913%2B16).\n\nIn 2014, the [BICEP2](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.\n\n> Does this mean we can control gravity?\n\nNo. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http:\/\/www.tapir.caltech.edu\/~teviet\/Waves\/gwave_spectrum.html).\n\n> What's the practical application?\n\n[Here](http:\/\/stuver.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.\n\n> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?\n\n[Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/44ht2f\/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed\/czqa5bv) is a recent \/r\/askscience discussion answering just that!

How accurate are names like \u201cOsiris\u201d and \u201cTutankhamen\u201d to what they actually sounded like when spoken by Ancient Egyptians? Egyptian is just an example in this question, and this can apply to Ancient Mayan mythology, or pretty much any ancient religion\/society \n\nThis has always confused me. Where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?\n\n****\n\n**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.\n\nFirst of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. \n\n* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class\/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. \n\n* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. \n\n* (This I found super interesting) Names\/words ending in \"is\/us\/os\" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. \n\n* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u\/goltrpoat: As an example, \"Tutankhamen\" (twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn) was likely pronounced as something like \"Tawat 'ankhu qaman\" ([ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n]).\n\n* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for \"mouth\" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (\"ro\") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u\/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. \n\nThanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn't know I had.

Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).\n\nThe \"could we have waited\" in the title is probably misleading\u2013I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean \"could\" in a narrow hypothetical (not, \"would it have been a good idea to wait\", which I highly doubt).","score":9.4555584776}

We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. \n\nOur results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http:\/\/www.palereddot.org\/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/palereddot\/](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/palereddot\/)\n\nWe will be available starting 22:00 CEST (16 ET, 20 UT).

{"title":"AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!","full_text":"AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything! An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https:\/\/www.eso.org\/public\/news\/eso2015\/\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

{"title":"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400\u00b0F, how is the earths core magnetic?","full_text":"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400\u00b0F, how is the earths core magnetic? After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).\n\nIm not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.\n\nAlso I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.\n\nSo I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.\n\nThen I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.\n\nSo I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.\n\nWhich brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?\n\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.\n\nThe major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.\n\nDoes that kinda summ it up?","score":9.1158098881}

I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect\/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways\/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.\n\nThe inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:\n\nCan someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics?

I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg\/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age\/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). \n\nAnd huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these \"because fat is bad\" useless and\/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. \n\nAnd yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).","score":9.0780653327}

I recently read an article in a French science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (Euclidian, finite and borderless). They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.\n\nI made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/C84eq)\n\n *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*\n\n *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*\n\n * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited\n\n * On the second line of the \"comic\" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !\n\n * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?\n\n\n**To recap**\n\nIt sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nChrist this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible. \n\nAlso thank you for the gilding !

A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.\n\nWe haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional \"Shadow.\" At least, as far as I know.\n\nI've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions.

I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: \n\n**1. The Moon**\n\n>u\/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/338\/6110\/1047\/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/294\/5541\/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.\n\n **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**\n\n> u\/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2019\/01\/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2019\/01\/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  \n>  \n>u\/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth\u2019s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https:\/\/eos.org\/articles\/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0012821X19300202). \n\n**3. Moldavite \u2013 Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**\n\n> u\/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https:\/\/www.arkadiancollection.com\/what-is-moldavite](https:\/\/www.arkadiancollection.com\/what-is-moldavite) \n\n**4. Hydrogen and Helium** \n\n>u\/SlowerThanLightSpeed: \"Jean's escape\" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmospheric\\_escape#Jeans\\_Escape](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   \n>  \n>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg\/s of hydrogen.\\[10\\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g\/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\\[10\\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\\[11\\] \n\n**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** \n\n>u\/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a \"supervolcano\" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http:\/\/volcano.oregonstate.edu\/ozone-destruction](http:\/\/volcano.oregonstate.edu\/ozone-destruction) \n>\n>u\/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km\/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

Is there a benefit to letting a fever run its course vs medicinal treatment? It's my understanding that a fever is an autoimmune response to the common cold, flu, etc. By raising the body's internal temperature, it makes it considerably more difficult for the infection to reproduce, and allows the immune system to fight off the disease more efficiently. \n\nWith this in mind, why would a doctor prescribe a medicine that reduces your fever? Is this just to make you feel less terrible, or does this actually help fight the infection?

AUA!","full_text":"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA! Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u\/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u\/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u\/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!\n\nPancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and\/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.\n\nWe studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.\n\nOur study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https:\/\/gut.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2022\/01\/26\/gutjnl-2021-324755\n\nA commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https:\/\/gut.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2022\/02\/21\/gutjnl-2021-326710\n\nFor less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https:\/\/www.worldwidecancerresearch.org\/news-opinion\/2022\/march\/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early\/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https:\/\/www.embl.org\/news\/science\/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer\/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https:\/\/www.cnio.es\/noticias\/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas\/).\n\nOur work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING\n\nThis is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. \n\nBut Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. \n\nSo is force really mass x acceleration?

My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA! I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http:\/\/tiny.ucsf.edu\/7uNbjg\n\nMy lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. \n\nBy producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.\n\n\nI'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!\n\nEDIT: I am signing off now, thank you for all the thoughtful questions and comments! \n\n\n","score":8.8861326182}

Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading.

{"title":"Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations?","full_text":"Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations? I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.\n\nI'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like \"if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?\" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a \"hide\" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?\n\nIt seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \\*where\\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and \"why\" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?\n\nEDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. \n\nPrecisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you \/u\/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.\n\nI didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a \"hiding\" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction\/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. \n\nHowever, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting\/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \\~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt\/rest cycle \\~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to \"learn\" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions\/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","score":8.8533796729}

Find images, videos, and everything you need to know about our historic mission to unfold the universe: [jwst.nasa.gov](http:\/\/jwst.nasa.gov).**\n\n-----\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.\n\nFor two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions.

I\u2019m [Brian Hare](https:\/\/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu\/people\/brian-hare), and I\u2019m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs\u2019 cognitive abilities \u2013 I\u2019m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating \u2013 and sometimes surprising \u2013 discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?\n \nA bit more about me: I\u2019m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https:\/\/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu\/research\/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https:\/\/www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. \n \nLet\u2019s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why \u2013 Ask Me Anything!\n \nFor background: Please learn more about me in [my bio here](https:\/\/www.dognition.com\/brian-hare) or check me out in the new podcast series [DogSmarts](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/dogsmarts\/id1115304038?mt=2) by Purina Pro Plan on iTunes and Google Play to learn more about dog cognition.\n \nThis AMA is being facilitated as part of a partnership between Dognition and Purina Pro Plan BRIGHT MIND, a breakthrough innovation for dogs that provides brain-supporting nutrition for cognitive health. \n \n**I'm here!

When a project like this is undertaken, how do we find people who have expertise in building them?  Furthermore, when the project ends, how is the expertise gained in building that project kept\/maintained for the next one?  Since these sort of projects are so rare, it seems hard for people to build up their experience to do each subsequent project better (as one would building multiple skyscrapers, or websites for example).\n\nAre these projects mostly done by people doing it for the first time?

A lot of people are focusing on the 'subway' example, which was which first prompted my question, but apparently aren't as rare as I first thought.

{"title":"Does gravity have a range or speed?","full_text":"Does gravity have a range or speed? So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km\/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is \"new gravity\" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?\n\nI realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case.

Before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, I think you get the picture. If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example.

I'm Kaeli Swift a behavioral ecologist specializing in crows and other corvids at the University of Washington.  Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia! \n\nYou can find coverage of my funeral work at [The New York Times](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/07\/19\/science\/crows-necrophilia.html), on the [Ologies](https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/podcast\/ologies\/e\/56956025) podcast, and PBS's [Deep Look](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ixYVFZnNl6s).  \n\nFor future crow questions, you can find me at my blog where I address common questions, novel research, myths, mythology, basically anything corvid related that people want to know about!  You can also find me here on [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Corvidresearch), [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/corvidresearch?lang=en), Instagram, and Facebook all at the corvidresearch handle.  \n\nI'm doing this AMA as part of [Science Friday's](https:\/\/www.sciencefriday.com\/) summer [Book Club](https:\/\/www.sciencefriday.com\/spotlights\/book-club-the-genius-of-birds\/) - they're reading The Genius of Birds by Jennifer Ackerman!

This is probably a very stupid question but Google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours. \n\nThe title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question, so let me explain it in more detail.\n\nFor example, a (obviously homozygous) blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child. The daughter would be (again obviously) heterozygous, hair color-wise, meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother. By the laws of (probably highly simplified) genetics, the daughter would have inhairited dark hair, as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype. However, as I understand, to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes, RANDOM one of the X chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated. Now back to the whole cat fiasco. I was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me. Since one of the cat's X chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair, and another variation of it codes for black, AND  one gets inactivated with basically a 50\/50 chance, the cats fur presents as a black-orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount\/pigment variation coded in a specific cell. Back to our heterozygous daughter. Why isn't her hair a blonde-black mosaic? If the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother, the strand should be blonde and vice versa.\nNow, I do have some theories about why that doesn't happen. For once, this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics, so I'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes. \nAnother explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats. \nUnfortunately, this just raised more questions in me. It can't only be cats then, right? Does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical? It also can't possibly only affect hair color, surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole. \nWhile answering, try not to be to rough. I'm only just out of high school and about to re-take my finals. I'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics, but sometimes I just don't completely understand. Hope I got the terminology right, my Polish high school offered an \"English speaking\" biology class but the teacher actually didn't speak any English and she would just resort to handing out some English homework she stole of the web, lol.","score":1.3862943611}

Hello all, I've been deeply interested in Planetary Sciences and the early evolution of the solar system.

The DFN images and studies the paths of fireballs in the sky, their trajectories, and orbits using intelligent imaging systems.

We both know it's possible, we both have watched old electricity meters (like [this one](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/40\/Drehstromzaehler_offen.jpg)) run backwards when either wired incorrectly or when the measured system is actually feeding power into the mains, for example with solar panels. And while I understand the basic principles of those old meters (it's essentially a finely tuned linear induction motor), what I can't figure out is how the **direction** of the powerflow is determined. Even worse with modern electronic meters, those don't even have moving parts where I could at least justify that they work the same as the old ones. And yet those to can determine the direction and don't measure currents running in the opposite direction (for example again with solar panels when you don't actually have a contact for receive compensation for the power you provide. The meter simply doesn't count up or down when you produce more than you need and thus are feeding into the mains. Mechanical meters solved this with a ratchet system.)\n\nAC power doesn't have an inherent direction, that's its fundamental principle. So how do those meters do it? The only thing I can come up with is that it's basically more like \"measuring\" the voltage differential between one side and the other, or at least that that is what determines the direction. But *how*? What physical effects are used to electronically measure if power is flowing from A to B and when it's going from B to A?\n\nThanks for any explanations you can provide, the more detailed and in depth the better.","score":7.1276936993}

I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.\n\nAgain this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling.

The way I understand it, the SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome, and it encodes for TDF. This, in turn, leads to prenatal testosterone and AMH. The prenatal testosterone lead to the development of the male reproductive system from the Wolffian duct while AMH leads to the disintegration of the Mullerian duct. Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testosterone or presence of AMH, the Wolffian duct disintegrates while the Mullerian duct develops into the female reproductive tract.\n\nIn that case, it seems like people with XO genotypes have no Y chromosome = no TDF = no AMH\/high levels of T, so they should develop ovaries. What am I missing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much everyone! This was super interesting.

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard\/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I use a mix of telescope observations, stellar evolution models, and Milky Way surveys to study binary stars -- that is, pairs of stars that are orbiting each other and (in most cases) formed from the same gas cloud. My collaborators and I recently published a [paper](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2209.06833) reporting the discovery of a binary containing a dormant black hole and a Sun-like star, orbiting each other at roughly the same distance as the Earth and the Sun. The black hole is about 10 times the mass of the Sun, so its event horizon is about 30 km. At a distance of about 1600 light years from Earth, it's about 3 times closer than the next-closest known black hole.\n\nThe black hole is fairly different from other stellar-mass black holes we know about, which are almost all bright X-ray and radio sources. They're bright because they're feeding on a companion star, and gas from the star forms a disk around the black hole where it gets heated to millions of degrees. That's how we discover those black holes in the first place. But in this one -- which we named Gaia BH1 -- the companion star is far enough away that the black hole isn't getting anything to eat, and so it's not bright in X-rays or radio. The only reason we know it's there at all is that we can see the effects of its gravity on the Sun-like star, which is orbiting an invisible object at a 100 km\/s clip.\n\n[Here's](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/05\/science\/astronomy-black-hole.html) a NYT article with more info about the discovery, and [here's](https:\/\/www.mpia.de\/news\/science\/2022-16-gaia-bh1) a press release that goes into somewhat more detail.\n\nAMA about this discovery, black holes, stars, astronomy, or anything else!

If we ignore the outermost superficial layer, are there any forensically measurable differences between people of different races or populations? I've been having this discussion with a friend, and realized that I needed to do more investigation. I referenced a 60 Minutes episode (from a few years ago) where a scientist was able to determine if somebody was white or black just by looking at accelerometer data from when they would jump on and off of a sensor. This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.\n\nMy friend countered with [this article](https:\/\/www.mcgill.ca\/oss\/article\/health-general-science\/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not race is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small.

{"title":"Is this a geometrical rationale for the \"360 degrees to a circle\" convention? (or a coincidence?)","full_text":"Is this a geometrical rationale for the \"360 degrees to a circle\" convention? (or a coincidence?) Playing some kids\u2019 geometric puzzle pieces (and then doing some pencil & paper checks), I realized something.\n\nIt started like this: I can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles, end-to-end, and get a cycle (a segmented circle). There are 30 shapes in this cycle (15 pentagon-triangle pairs), and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments.\n\n[Here is a figure to show what i'm talking about] (https:\/\/imgur.com\/NfXtoDK)\n\nYou can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle: 6 square-pentagon pairs, dividing the perimeter into 12 segments.\n\nAnd then you can just build it with triangles - basically you just get a hexagon with six sides.\n\nFor regular polygons beyond the pentagon, it changes. Hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line (actually, you *can* get a cycle out of these, but it isn't of segments like all the others). Then, you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 24-gons. For those, respectively, the perimeter (now the \u2018inner\u2019 boundary of the pattern - see the figure above for an example) is divided into 24, 18, 12, 10, and 8 segments.\n\nYou can also make cycles with some polygons on their own: triangles, squares, hexagons (three hexagons in sequence make a cycle), and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons (with four or eight). You can also make cycles with some other combinations (e.g. 10(*edited from 5*) pentagon-square pairs).\n\nHere\u2019s what I realized:\nThe least common multiple of those numbers (the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is *360*! (at least, I\u2019m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).\n\nThis means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle, and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment, you need 360 subdivisions.\n\nAm I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees? The wikipedia article claims it\u2019s not known for certain but seems weighted for a \u201cit\u2019s close to the # of days in the year\u201d explanation, and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a *convenient* number (can be divided lots and lots of ways - which seems related to what I noticed). Surely I am not the first discoverer of this pattern.. in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient Mesopotamian to discover..\n\n*\n*\n*edit for tldr*\n*\n*\n\nFor those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle *but it has nothing to do with choice of units*. *It's a coincidence*, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).\n\n\nThe most common response below is basically what wikipedia says (i.e. common knowledge); 360 is a highly composite number, divisible by the Babylonian 60, and is close to the number of days in the year, so that probably is why the number was originally chosen. But I already recognized these points in my original post.. what I want to know is whether or not this **coincidence** has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with \"360\", *even if it's probably not true*.\n\nThanks!","score":7.3492308246}

Does the fraction of lone pair electrons in a paramagnetic substance change dependent on the strength of an applied magnetic field?**\n\n**2. Does the speed at which the electrons relocalize change in response to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field?** (ie. maybe we just didn't wait long enough to observe the change)\n\n**3.

For example this quote ( [Artificial Sweeteners Alter Gut Bacteria in Humans | The Scientist Magazine\u00ae (the-scientist.com)](https:\/\/www.the-scientist.com\/news-opinion\/artificial-sweeteners-alter-gut-bacteria-in-humans-70395) ):\n\n\" Now, working in the lab of Weizmann Institute of Science immunologist Eran Elinav, Suez and colleagues have taken an array of common artificial sweeteners\u2014saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia\u2014and filled that gap in the literature by testing them in humans. Their findings, described today (August 19) in [*Cell*](https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cell.2022.07.016), suggest these sweeteners do indeed alter the gut microbiome, as was seen in prior mouse work. This, the researchers say, adversely impacts glucose tolerance, a measure of how readily the body moves sugar from the blood into muscle and fat, possibly leading to weight gain and diabetes. \"\n\nMy question is, are \"natural\" sweeteners such as those based on Monk Fruit (which gets its sweetness from a compound called, \"mogroside V\" and is often mixed with erythritol) chemically similar to artificial sweeteners and do they carry the same health risks?\n\nI have been using monk fruit for almost two years - and recently found my blood sugar levels are too high (despite being slender and extremely fit).

It looks like [in 2012 someone at the Max Planck Institute succeeded in building gold lenses?](https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/high-energy-radiation-is-refracted-setting-the-stage-for-gamma-optics\/)\n\n> Scientists at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have opened up a new chapter in optics: in experiments with gamma rays at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble they have proven that these extremely high-energy electromagnetic waves can be focused by lenses like conventional light \u2014 the researchers have thus refuted a fundamental assumption of theoretical physics that had been valid for decades. Their discovery will make a great many new applications possible in medicine and materials research, for example.  \n> Optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes are based on the refraction of light: in a medium such as glass the electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly than in air or in a vacuum, and are therefore diffracted \u2014 for example, onto the focal plane of a photo camera. The refractive index, which depends on the lens material and the frequency of the waves, describes how large this effect is: the more it deviates from 1, the stronger the diffraction of the light beams.  \n> Until now, physicists had assumed that electromagnetic radiation with far greater energy than that in the visible spectrum could not be diffracted with lenses. They had calculated that the refractive index in this region of the spectrum is almost precisely 1 for all materials. **However, back in the mid-1990s it turned out that X-rays are also diffracted by beryllium or carbon lenses, and thus that X-ray optics were possible.**  \n> When Dietrich Habs, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in Munich and Fellow of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, and his team were making their measurements at the ILL they discovered that this also applies to the even higher energy gamma-rays \u2014 after X-ray optics, the era of gamma optics is now beginning.\n\nTIL [X-Ray Optics](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-ray_optics) appear to have been a thing for a while, including [mirrors](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-ray_optics#Mirrors_for_X-ray_optics).","score":7.5647570129}

At this point, I feel like there's an ethical issue because are we not knowingly taking individuals with a life threatening illness and deliberately giving them a non treatment?

{"title":"How does exit area for a rocket nozzle affect thrust?","full_text":"How does exit area for a rocket nozzle affect thrust? Let me lead off by saying I *am* aware of the equation for this. I'm confused by some of the details. I've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and I'm struggling to pick apart this particular question.\n\nSo in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure (etc.) which are basically a function of the reactants you are using. These determine the area of the throat, which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point. You need the A\\* that gives M=1 at the throat.\n\nBut I'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that... Here's a few things I do understand:\n\n* The propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat. Velocity increases as the area expands.\n* Temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases.\n* Ideally, you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure. (This is mainly about efficiency?)\n* The exact shape (and length?) isn't super important. It's mostly just about weight and cost.\n\nI guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused. When I look at the equation for thrust, there's two terms:\n\n1. mass flow rate \\* exit velocity\n2. exit area \\* pressure difference from ambient\n\nLet me assume a fixed mass flow rate. The equation for exit velocity is... basically a function of exit pressure. The other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel\/oxidizer and other initial conditions. The exact term where it appears is `1-Pe\/P0` so I think what that's saying is the \"ideal\" is zero exit pressure? The higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion, the less energy you've gotten out of it. And lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area.\n\nBut then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term. Because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative.\n\nAm I right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike? And shooting for Pe=Pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust?","score":2.5649493575}

However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.\n\nRecent preparation on the Edmontosaurus mummy \"Dakota\" revealed the first evidence of predator activity on dinosaurian soft tissues and provided an alternate explanation for how these rare fossils form.

As I understand it, this is evolutionarily almost inevitable: if a strain has a mutation that makes it more transmissible, it should generally outcompete less transmissible variants until it becomes dominant (exceptions being 1) if it is substantially more lethal such that it kills people before they can spread it, but this hasn't been a factor for Covid-19, and 2) if a variant is better able to overcome prior immunity, it may become dominant even if it doesn't have an inherent transmissibility advantage). This happened with Alpha, then Delta, the Omicron, etc. \n\nThe implication seems to be that infectious diseases should have evolutionary pressures almost constantly pushing them towards greater infectiousness. \n\nHowever (to my understanding), the flu hasn't inevitably gotten more infectious over time.

The lab then tests those cells for any abnormalities (aneuploidy, etc) while the embryos get frozen. Once results are back the cleared embryos can be implanted one at a time until one takes.\n\nSo there has been some research on childhood cancer risk of frozen embryos and that seems to be a bit elevated relative to standard - 1.6-1.7 times.\n\nhttps:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosmedicine\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1004078\n\nThis is still a fairly new process and we don\u2019t know if there are any impacts later in life from freezing, it\u2019s an open question as frozen embryo children hit middle age.

Which means even if the time is infinite, you will still not see character combinations outside the limit of what the monkey can write. \n\n**EDIT: Ok, so people have said to me that it's just a mathematical construct. Which means, it's not true: Monkeys can't write the complete works of Shakespeare in an inifnite amount of time.**\n\n**What is true then is that something like a randomness machine, which is typing keys randomly at a typewriter, would eventually write any book that's ever existed, given enough time.

And since the comments are misunderstanding it is further reason to elaborate.\n\nA coil spring seems like a hybrid of a torsion spring and a flexion spring. Flexion spring: think safety pin or leaf spring. Torsion spring: think paper clip. \n\nAs a coil spring extends it becomes more sensitive to flexion and less sensitive to torsion. As it compresses it becomes more sensitive to torsion and less sensitive to flexion.  \n\nSo with the shape of the Slinky, it is easily deformed near its compressed state since it is sensitive to torsion.

{"title":"Brushed DC motor as generator, how does electric output power versus mechanical output power differ with varying electric loads?","full_text":"Brushed DC motor as generator, how does electric output power versus mechanical output power differ with varying electric loads? Hi everyone, I've been googling for a while and can't find an answer that takes into account both scenarios. \n\nSay you have a brushed DC motor acting as a generator and you can connect different loads to it (10 ohms, 100ohms, 5ohms...) but you cannot control the input (like the wind). How does this affect both the mechanical output power AND the electric output power?\nI'm thinking of renewable energy, and usually when in numerical modeling, mechanical power is used as Pmech =c*w^2 (damping times speed). With a higher electrical resistance as the load, the speed lowers but you have a higher damping value. If you were to graph this there is some \"knee\" of optimal damping to yield highest mechanical power.\nBut what happens with electrical power? With a higher load, the generator would move slower, and produce less voltage. So wouldn't we have Pelec = V^(2)\/R, where V is lower and R is high, creating an overall low electric power?\nThank you!","score":1.6094379124}

[500 Women Scientists](http:\/\/500womenscientists.org\/) is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.\n\n500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from [small groups, not large crowds](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/11\/what-successful-movements-have-in-common). Our [Local Pods](https:\/\/500womenscientists.org\/take-action\/#pods) help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.\n\nWith us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.\n\n1. Wendy Bohon (Dr_Wendy) - Hi, I'm Dr. Wendy Bohon! My research focuses on examining how the surface and near surface of the earth changes as the result of earthquakes. I also work on improving public education and perception of science, particularly seismology and earthquake hazards. I'm a woman, a scientist, a mother and a proud member of 500 Women Scientists!\n\n2. Hi, I'm [Kelly Fleming](https:\/\/kellylfleming.com\/), AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and co-leader of 500 Women Scientists. I firmly believe that for science to serve all of society, it must be accessible to diverse people - including underrepresented minorities, immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA people. Although I don't do research anymore, my Ph.D. is in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, where I studied reactions that help turn plant material into fuels. \n\n3. Tessa Hill - I am [Tessa Hill](http:\/\/hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com\/), an oceanographer at UC Davis, based at [Bodega Marine Laboratory](http:\/\/bml.ucdavis.edu\/).  I study impacts of climate change on the ocean, including ocean acidification, which is a chemical change occurring in the ocean due to our carbon dioxide emissions. I am excited to be working with 500 Women Scientists to encourage a diverse, inclusive and thriving scientific community.  You can find me on Twitter (@Tessa_M_Hill) and our lab Facebook page https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/oceanbiogeochemistry\n\n4. Monica Mugnier (MonicaMugnier) - Hi, I'm Dr. Monica Mugnier.

{"title":"Why are ionization energies so much larger than electron affinities?","full_text":"Why are ionization energies so much larger than electron affinities? As I understand it, the ionization energy is the energy required to take an electron away, off of an atom. Electron affinity, on the other hand is kind of the opposite, as it's the amount of energy given off when an electron is given to an atom. As such, I thought they'd be similar in terms of value.\n\nI've been looking at charts of electron affinity and first ionization energies, and it seems that that's not the case, however. For example, hydrogen has an ionization energy of 1312 kJ\/mol... but an electron affinity of only 73 kJ\/mol. What's up with that? The electron affinity is less than a tenth of the ionization energy. Both values deal in putting\/removing an electron around the hydrogen atom... why does the change in energy vary so much? This doesn't seem to just be hydrogen, either, as even the lowest first ionization energy (Fr, ~380 kJ\/mol) is larger than the largest electron affinity (Cl ~349 kJ\/mol).\n\nI've been trying to understand this and in looking further I've only gotten more confused by looking at standard enthalpy of formation too... If I want to make a mole of NaCl, I'd have to take a mole of Na, and a mole of Cl, and move the electron from every Na atom to a Cl one, right? So that's 496 kJ\/mol to take the electrons off of Na, and 349 kJ\/mol back when I give them to Cl, so I guessed that this whole process should take 147 kJ. But the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl is about -411 kJ\/mol, which means its an exothermic reaction. Where is this additional ~558 kJ\/mol coming from?\n\nApologies if my understanding of these concepts is wrong... but could someone possibly explain why it is this way?","score":1.3862943611}

These legacy structures modulate soil fertility, individual plant response, and subsequent large-scale ecosystem patterns.\n\nIn recent years, incredible attention has been paid to their use as a soil amendment - converting waste biomass into charcoals, \"biochars\" - dually capturing carbon and increasing soil fertility in managed ecosystems. Most data synthesis, including my own with Dr. Sean Thomas at Toronto, show on average \\~41% increase in biomass responses.\n\nSource: [https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11056-015-9491-7](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11056-015-9491-7)\n\nHowever, much variation ensues from the applied usage in agricultural and forestry contexts - including negative responses. The mechanisms that drive these detrimental effects are many. Still, research shows that low molecular weight leachates (i.e., acids, phenols, VOCs), Ash, and sometimes metals could be responsible for a mismatch in soil physiochemistry.

However, there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations. \n\nFor example, the people who historically populated and continue to populate the Himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates, helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes. \n\nFurthermore, the peoples of Central Africa have a specialized susceptibility to Sickle-Celled Anaemia, which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors. \n\nEven the Germanic people of Northern Europe are in their own way specialized, having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world, thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase. \n\nThese populations standing as examples, I believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates (prior to today's heavily interconnected society) into human taxonomical subspecies, and I wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not. \n\nIf the mods think this question is best placed in another subreddit please, by all means let me know and I will post it there instead.

{"title":"Does new evidence point to Geocentrism?","full_text":"Does new evidence point to Geocentrism? So, this is going to be my first reddit post, and hopefully you guys and gals can help me out.\n\nThe other day I heard a noise coming from my computer, it was the warning alert indicating that someone on the internet was wrong. I therefore engaged in a brief discussion with someone who advocates Geocentrism. Never having been exposed to this seriously outside of history classes about Galileo\/Copernicus, and having a computer science background, I didn't feel well equipped to debate this strident person, who was apparently free of any doubt.\n\nStill curious, however, I have since been trying to figure out what the consensus is on the data re:geocentrism.\n\nAs far as I could understand, he's stating that the [MM experiments](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michelson-Morley_experiment), the [CMB data from WMAP and SSDS](http:\/\/magisterialfundies.blogspot.com\/2012\/09\/newest-observational-evidence-shows.html), and just recently the [Planck data](http:\/\/magisterialfundies.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/copernican-principle-1532-2013-rip-why.html) all point to the Earth as being a privileged, non-relativistic frame.\n\nI've checked out [Plait's response](http:\/\/blogs.discovermagazine.com\/badastronomy\/2010\/09\/14\/geocentrism-seriously\/#.UUycXhxwpOg) to some non-specific Geocentrist claims, and incedentally Delano's [friend's response to it](http:\/\/www.galileowaswrong.com\/galileowaswrong\/features\/5.pdf).\n\nI have also watched the 4 [extant videos created by CHL](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wyRJZbNmC7U#!), as well as various wikipedia\/rationalwiki pages etc...\n\nBut I was hoping for specific refutations of the things linked above, MMX and CMB information. I realize that this guy is a fundamentalist, and as such isn't susceptible to the kind of reason that sways me, but I would like to get a better grasp on the size and scope of his wrongness. \n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo, first of all, thanks to all those who took the time and effort to give responses to my original questions, many of them were very informative. As my first experience posting on askscience, and reddit in general, this has gone better than it could have.\n\nNext; an apology.\n\nI was originally thinking of posting these questions in one of the atheism, debate religion, or philosophy subs, but in the end I went with askScience because I figured there would be more experts in the relevant Astronomy\/Astrophysics\/Physics subjects here.\n\nI arrived at these questions through my interactions with religious people on their blogs. I had never encounter a modern-day geocentrist before, and so was unwilling to continue discussing the points he made with the little information I had at my disposal at the time. Not having NdGT's, Kaku's, Hawking's or Plait's numbers on hand anymore, I thought I might try to get these questions answered here.\n\nI then made the mistake of linking directly to that person's blog in my OP, which I am assuming is to blame for his incredibly quick arrival at this thread. I hope that the distinction is clear between my OP, looking for factual information about real data and theory, and the person who later made an appearance here. My training is as a computer scientist, and though I was contemplating copy-pastaing the blog-points which I eventually linked to, something about the unnecessary duplication of a wall o' text verbatim is nails\/chalkboard to me. I realize now that there may have been unforeseen negatives to that decision, which would have made it worth while to spend the time.\n\nI've noted the shocked tone of some of the original responses, followed by frustration and eventually dismissal. I personally feel that any and all questions are healthy and important to ask, so long as one is willing and capable of accepting the best answers provided by reason and evidence, so I sympathize.\n\nWhether or not this thread eventually devolved into more noise than signal is obviously up to you to decide, but for my part I got some questions answered, and I suppose I got to eat some popcorn while an intellectual train wreck occurred in front of me.\n\nI will attempt to collect a quick list of the information that I've learned as a result of this, and post it below.","score":0.6931471806}

My textbook says\n\n>As paleomagnetists sampled and measured older and older rocks, **their results seemed to show that the north magnetic pole was far from the modern pole and appeared to wander through time**. This was called the \u201cpolar wander hypothesis\u201d at first. But then they ran into a problem. Each continent had a completely different polar wander curve, which only converged on a common magnetic pole today. These data seemed to suggest that the magnetic field had behaved very strangely in the past, with multiple directions of magnetic north that no longer exist. As outrageous as that  idea seemed, the only alternative was just as radical: **the continents had moved through time, so it was not the magnetic pole that was changing but the continents** **that recorded their directions**. But when you lined up the polar wander curves for two different continents, like Europe and North America, you found that they matched once you moved  the continents back together as Wegener had suggested. **In other words, the \u201cpolar wander curves\u201d were only apparent polar wander curves because it was the continents that moved, not the magnetic poles.**\n\nWhat I'm confused about is my book saying, \"the continents had moved through time, so it was *not the magnetic pole that was changing*\" because isn't that not completely true since magnetic North DOES move? We've observed this movement, so isn't my book completely dismissing the idea of a \"wandering pole\" incorrect?\n\nEverything I've watched and read online only talks about the effect of continental drift on the apparent wander curves, but they haven't talked about how the magnetic North pole does, in fact, move.

At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter\/energy) acted, but only the particles were \"real\" (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as \"spin\" is an abstract concept.\n\nAt which point was it decided that \"the field(s)\" is a real physical entity? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s\/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical\/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.\n\nAnd there's no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field. It reminds me of the switch from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Heliocentrism as a theory was worse back then, it took some time to iron out the problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems that Wheeler\/Feynman didn't buy the foundations of the then current physics and tried to base a theory on the \"action at a distance\"; but it seems that it was abandoned, seeing the success of GR and QM.","score":0.0}

According to a lot of current research, Plan B has been proven to have no post-fertilization effects specifically regarding an alteration of the endrometrium. However, I also happened upon a fairly recent article:\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5102184\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5102184\/)\n\nThat claims the following: \"The mechanism of action of LNG-EC is reviewed. The drug has no ability to alter sperm function at doses used *in vivo* and has limited ability to suppress ovulation. Our analysis estimates that the drug's ovulatory inhibition potential could prevent less than 15 percent of potential conceptions, thus making a pre-fertilization mechanism of action significantly less likely than previously thought. Luteal effects (such as decreased progesterone, altered glycodelin levels, and shortened luteal phase) present in the literature may suggest a pre-ovulatory induced post-fertilization drug effect.\"\n\nThe evidence seems pretty compelling to point towards the fact that pre-fertilization effects of the drug are not the sole method of pregnancy prevention, or even the most common method. As someone who believes that life begins at conception, this is troubling for me. I took a Plan B thinking it would have no adverse affects on a potential embryo that had already formed in me, and then I experienced bleeding the next few days which made me want to research more into Plan B's potential to act as an abortifacient.\n\nTL:DR: Research surrounding Plan B is highly contested, but articles such as the one above suggest that Plan B has post-fertilization effects.

However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics.

Hello, me and a friend were just watching some vids about time dilation and me and my buddy are trying to figure out where our logic is wrong here, so it would be great to see what we are missing.\n\nUnderstandings:\n\n**When moving at the speed of light away from a clock, the clock would be perceived as 'frozen' to the travelling person's eyes.**\n\nWhat I don't understand about this is that, from what I know the way the eye works is that light must hit the retina for my brain to perceive an image. But surely if I'm moving away at the same speed the light is (both constant speeds), then the first bit of light might hit my eye, but after that there is no distance being made between the light and my eye since both are the same constant speed (for example 2 cars travelling in front of each other in the same direction at the same speed would never actually hit). Surely nothing would be hitting my eye anymore.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\n**I have heard a lot that time dilation is just perspective, just like when I mentioned above, time seemed to be frozen due to moving away from the clock at the speed of light.**\n\nWhat I also don't get about this is that, time 'seems' to be frozen, however this is just because the light is not given the chance to hit my retina, surely that's just a visual effect. I have heard that time dilation could theoretically affect how you would age compared to another perspective, but I just don't see how that is the case since everything is to do with 'perspective'.\n\nSurely travelling away from that clock at the speed of light doesn't actually stop time for me as an observer, it just stops me seeing the light coming off of it which tells me the clock is ticking.

But what is \"speed\" without a reference point? How do we measure speed in space? And why would my following example not be possible according to current theories about the speed of light? Example:\n\nThis is my own home grown \"theory\" claiming that stuff *can* in fact go faster than the \"speed\" of light.\n\nLet's say all sorts of planetary and star-like  bodies in this universe are moving all over the place. We are rotating around the sun, but for what it's worth our sun might be moving in relation to another body in space as well. Which in turn might have some sort of speed\/direction in relation to another body in space. What if this would create a chain, which would eventually, theoretically, line up perfectly, and meet another chain that has lined up perfectly as well, but in the other \"direction\", meet each other at the \"fastest\" point of the chain? This \"speed\" of the chain would in this case be referenced to the first body which in this theory doesn't have a relevant motion.\n\nThe way this all works out in my head is that, theoretically, those two \"fastest\" bodies would have some sort of speed. (but both compared tho which reference point? Could you take just one of the two starting points?) And when they meet, would it's speed effectively be \"zero\" on one of the planets, and double the \"speed\" that both are moving on the other planet?\n\nIf so, then if the chain is long enough, why wouldn't they be able to reach a \"speed\" faster than light when they collide or closely pass each other?\n\nIn this entire story and theory, I just have to get back to the point that speed is a funny thing because of reference points etc. and you could totally say it's very relative. If it's relative then how can we claim light to be the fastest thing?\n\nAlso, how do we \"know\" it's the fastest thing? Is it just because we just don't know of anything that is faster?(which would be very stupid reasoning in my book) Or is there some solid math behind this?\n\n\nOn a related point, if galaxies are moving towards each other, these would have immense speed as well, but if light as the absolute highest speed, what would possibly be the thing that is limiting the speed of galaxies? and compared to *what*?

THCA is a mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory but does not have good affinity with our CB1 receptors...\n\nWhile I'm familiar with marijuana vaporization, this seems to be something different. Traditionally vaporized pot is less potent afterwards, not more.

Thus giving the nutrinos a head start.\n\n\nMy question is this: was the basis for this theory that the cosmic speed limit of light speed must be true and so nutrinos must have come out earlier, or have we independently verified that they were released earlier than the other stuff?\n\nMy concern is that our limited ability to test nutrinos may cloud our reasoning and that they may exceed the speed of light.

He says that this is because the slower IR rays have a more difficult time passing through clear bodies in the atmosphere than visible light (which I kinda assumed was because IR moves more slowly than visible light), and upon contact with the opaque surface of the earth, the visible light is converted to IR. But I read recently that infrared can pass through dense gasses, some of which are even opaque - I understand that since it came out in the early 1800's, Fourier's paper is a little outdated\n\nSo is he wrong?

Title was mean to say \"I know this is an old topic\" my bad.\n\nArticle in question: http:\/\/www.apa.org\/science\/about\/psa\/2003\/10\/anderson.aspx\n\nThe statements that Dr. Craig Anderson make seem a little odd.\n\nThis for example: Myth 6. There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression. \nFacts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).\n\nHe doesn't really say if it's a huge reason why those acts happen or if its just a factor. Also it seems odd since last I checked there wasn't any epidemic of robberies and assault done in the name of video games. Or is it the same old, oh this person played violent video games and robbed someone\/attacked someone, clearly the video games were on of the main reasons! I don't see my friends going around robbing people or attacking them. Sure some people do it, but isn't because its violent video games on top of being already mentally aggressive and having a troubled youth? Also the whole delinquency angle sounds strange to me, is there any merit to that claim outside of his own study?\n\nAnother statement he makes that I find odd: Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing. \nFacts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.\n\nPay attention to this \"Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.\" He stated that video games have been linked to robbery and assault, but says it is only a small factor now. It sounds like he was trying to make video games sound WAY worse than they really are. Also what annoys me about this whole article, is that it doesn't touch on the subject of do video games directly make people violent. As in if I don't have other risk factors or I have very few, could video games alone make me into a violent person?\n\nAnyways thanks to whoever has read this, if you are a professional on this type of stuff I would really appreciate an answer\/perspective. Thanks in advance!\n\n\nEdit: Another claim he made in a testimony to the senate: Myth 2. Violent media have harmful effects only on a very small minority of people who use these media. One version of this myth is commonly generated by parents who allow their children to watch violent movies and play violent games. It generally sounds like this, \"My 12 year old son watches violent TV shows, goes to violent movies, and plays violent video games, and he's never killed anyone.\" Of course, most people who consume high levels of violent media, adults or youth, do not end up in prison for violent crimes. Most smokers do not die of lung cancer, either. The more relevant question is whether many (or most) people become more angry, aggressive, and violent as a result of being exposed to high levels of media violence. Are they more likely to slap a child or spouse when provoked? Are they more likely to drive aggressively, and display \"road rage?\" Are they more likely to assault co-workers? The answer is a clear yes.\n\nWhere is the evidence for this clear yes? I never slapped a child or any of my family members. I never assaulted a co-worker. Only person I ever fought were bullies who harassed me. And I am pretty sure most people if they got bullied a lot would retaliate. Its not uncommon at all...","score":4.248495242}

Since the earth's tilt will be completely tilted in the opposite direction every \\~13k years, we can expect summer to be in January in the northern hemisphere in the year 15,020 CE.  However, we should be able to see a continual shift in the date of the seasons as the earth's tilt precesses.  So, I was thinking:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Half the precession of the equinox is \\~13k years\n2. 13k years to shift summer to winter (roughly 180 day      shift of the seasons)\n3. 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600      years.\n4. I think we should recognize a 36 day shift in the      seasons.\n\nI tried to find some data on the summer harvest dates or seasonal changes, but I haven't found anything yet.  I found a reference in Robert Sallares book, \"The ecology of the ancient Greek world\", where on page 391 he says: \" A consensus has developed among ancient historians that the climate of Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE was virtually identical to the present-day climate.\"\n\nThis would suggest that the precession of the earth\u2019s axis has no effect on the seasons.

This is something I vaguely remember reading in a textbook in my psychology degree but I haven't found anything relevant when trying to Google to confirm it. If I remember rightly, receptors that produce EPSPs are on the more distal part of the dendrites, while IPSP-producing receptors are either directly on the soma or at least on more proximal parts of the dendrites. The \"explanation\" (not so much of the mechanism which is obviously to do with ions and G proteins, rather it was more a way of thinking of it that helps you remember it, supposedly) was that it was like the IPSPs had to originate along the pathway EPSPs took to the axon hillock so they could intercept them. Or, it may have been the other way round, that the EPSPs had to be closer so they could overcome the IPSPs. I clearly remember that something was overcoming something else; unfortunately, you can conceptualise that both ways.\n\nAlternatively, the distinction may have been between the ionotropic and metabotropic receptors instead. Or, maybe, based on my lack of success Googling, neither of these things is true at all and you find receptors of all types all over the shop. \n\nSo, Reddit, can you help?

Is this because of the T symmetry of the weak force?\n\nAs for Gamma ray bursts\n\nDo we know the actual mechanism of how they form? I mean, something more profound than the formation of a blackhole due to the collapse of a star or merge\/collision.\n\nWhere does the released energy actually come from? Is it due to the fusion of whatever is inside a neutron star to whatever is inside of a black hole and\/or particles disintegrating into pure energy\/photons?\n\nSecondly, why does it come out of the poles? Is it because of the star's magnetic field? But given that photons are neutrally charged, why would the magnetic field matter?\n\nThirdly, say you have a neutron star just on the edge of it's upper mass limit and a small comet crashes into to, taking it over the edge and making it collapse.

{"title":"Could geothermal energy harvesting near volcanically active regions reduce frequency or severity of volcanos or earthquakes?","full_text":"Could geothermal energy harvesting near volcanically active regions reduce frequency or severity of volcanos or earthquakes? I have a cursory understanding that volcano eruptions are the product of years of heat\/pressure build up underneath the ground, and I was wondering if it was even remotely practical for a community to install geothermal power plants near volcanically active sites as a way to absorb some of this heat\/pressure build up, as a way to reduce the intensity or frequency of future eruptions.\n\nFor some reference, I found that the Krakatoa eruption is estimated to have released 8x10^(17) J of energy ([source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy))), as if the worldwide geothermal power capacity in 2019 was 15.4 GW \/ 15.4x10^(9) ([source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geothermal_power)). So if the entire world's 2019 geothermal power generation capacity was concentrated on Krakatoa, then some basic calculations would mean it would take \\~600 days to absorb all of the estimated energy released by Krakatoa:\n\n>8x10^(17) \/ 15.4x10^(9) \/ 24 (hours in a day) \/ 60 (minutes in an hour) \/ 60 (seconds in a minute)\n\nAs of 2019, the US has 3.68 GW \/ 3.68x10^(9) ([source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geothermal_power)) geothermal power capacity installed, so this same situation would take \\~2500 days to absorb all of the estimated energy released by Krakatoa. \n\nWhile extracting all of the energy of a potential volcano probably isn't practical, it doesn't seem completely impractical to absorb those sort of scales energy over the span of human lifetimes.","score":3.7612001157}

At first I thought they meant that receiving a heart allograft means you have to take life-long immunosuppresant therapy for it to work, but then I realized that the denervation part cannot be solved by immunosuppresants. Right now I am at a loss to be honest, how does heart transplantation even work? Do the nerves reattach themselves in some case?

I pretty much see this topic ignored by physicists (though I'm not particularly well-read in the subject). I don't think this question should only be discussed in other fields: conscious experience is a very real property of energy of certain distribution, that must be addressed by a true theory of everything. \n\nThrough the limited perspective I have on physics right now, I see that scientists are trying to find a theory that explains every material process without taking consciousness into consideration. I think this is not the best approach: how can you explain **every** property of the proton without knowing its role in generating consciousness?\n\nEDIT: I found a [much better description](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Theory_of_everything_%28philosophy%29#Ways_forward) of the problem than my driveling above:\n\n> In his 1996 book The Conscious Mind,[4] David Chalmers argues that a theory of everything must explain consciousness, that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything. A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but phenomenal or protophenomenal properties and psychophysical laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience. He concludes that \"[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything.\" Developing such a theory will not be straightforward, he says, but \"it ought to be possible in principle.\"","score":1.3862943611}

With fossil fuels being consumed out or restricted, as the world moves towards the use of electricity as their primary power source, I wonder about the solutions that will come forward to replace gas heating. \n\nI am from Pakistan. We have a dwindling supply of natural gas, and every day, more and more people are forced to abandon the hope of having a room that is amply heated. Simply because the available gas isn't even enough to power their stoves. For those that have an electric heater, they quickly realize that their electricity bill is skyrocketing and they simply cannot heat their rooms like the good old gas heater days. \n\nAnd since there's no way to significantly increase the efficiency of an electric heater, since it is literally a resistor converting almost all its current into heat, they will be forced to consider, what I can only define as \"thermal efficiency\". \n\nThese thermal efficiency techniques can be something simple like reducing the size of the room to be heated by adding additional false ceilings and cubicle-like structures, to something much more drastic like an electric heating suit or robe that we can put on. \n\nOf course, this would not be necessary if somehow the cost of producing electricity is reduced to a point that efficiency doesn't matter anymore (like the good old gas heaters). \n\nSo I wonder, am I thinking in the right direction?

{"title":"What's the average number of attempts necessary to reach 1,000 successes at a 1% rate?","full_text":"What's the average number of attempts necessary to reach 1,000 successes at a 1% rate? So in statistics I understand that, given a 1% chance of success, it will take an average of 68.something attempts to succeed, because the equation is .99^x = .5 and you solve for x.  However, does that mean that the average attempts to get, say, 1,000 successes at a 1% rate would be ~68,000?  On one hand, it makes sense that you would just multiply the average attempts by the number of successes necessary.  However, looking at it from the standpoint of common sense, a 1\/100 chance times 1,000 necessary successes should just be 100*1,000.  Which number is correct (if either) and why?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: for further clarification, I'm basically asking a question that's an extension of [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/25qsv7\/eli5_if_i_attempt_something_with_1_probability) old Reddit post.  If .99^100 = X and X is about .64, then you can just substitute X for number of attempts instead of probability and thus find the average number of attempts in order to have any given chance of success, correct?  That is, .99^x = .5, so x =68.9676.  This seems to assert that, after about 69 attempts, you would have a 50% chance of success.  So why doesn't that translate into chance of having a certain number of successes within a certain number of attempts?  Or why is this number not 100, since intuitively it should take an average of 100 attempts to succeed given a 1% chance of success? ","score":1.3862943611}

When a woman is born she already has all the eggs she will ever have. Women do not produce more so that's it.\n2. When a woman is pregnant she (typically) will stop ovulating for the duration of the pregnancy, and may not start again for up to a year after giving birth.\n\nSo let's say a woman has 10 healthy to term pregnancies. We can average that out to 18m per pregnancy where she does not ovulate. Over those 10 pregnancies that adds up to 15 years of not ovulating.\n\nSo theoretically could that delay her from starting menopause for up to 15 years?\n\n\nAlso please don't come at me over this question.

I have observed that whenever questions about evolution and natural selection come up (here, or in other contexts), people providing answers are often quick to point out that randomly occuring *mutations* are responsible (and required) for introducing new or modified features in organisms, that are then selected for or against, determining the likelihood\/rate of that mutation surviving in the gene pool.\n\nHowever, as an interested layperson (my knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics is mostly based on biology class back in school, and on reading popular science like Dawkins, Sagan, Bryson), my intuitive understanding of evolution and natural selection makes me believe that the *main* driving force behind the changes needed to keep evolution going is merely the *genetic variation* occuring \"naturally\" due to sexual reproduction, when the genes of two individuals are shuffeled and recombined. Sure, the occasional spontaneous mutation is needed as some sort of catalyst, speeding things up, and introducing radical changes that might turn out successful or not. But overall, mutations are by far not the main cause behind genetic modifications required for evolution - most of those are covered by standard genetic variation.\n\nNow, I'm wondering: How accurate is that intuitive understanding of mine? Are there any numbers \/ estimates about how much influcence mutations have on the variety of the gene pool, as opposed to the variation already provided by sexual reproduction?\n\n\n","score":1.6094379124}

BUT EVERY book about fluid dynamics or turbomachinery OMITS THE EXACT causal link of how a stator (if the compressor is of such design) creates pressure. It usually vaguely talks about the stator being a diffusor, but on the same time the flow area of the annular stream continually grows smaller and smaller through the compressor.\n\nIn other words: How does it work that a flow is diffused (subsonic design) and at the same time the flow area is reduced. Obviously this can't work the way I describe the question, but the phrasing of the question is well formed to exactly depict how much I understand and what's still missing.\n\nSo, what exact characteristic of the stator (is it the curvature, the thickness, the nozzle spatial geometry,...) causes the pressure to rise from the velocity AND how do I bring this in accordance of the steady reduction of flow are throughout the compressor?\n\nI REALLY appreaciate an answer as not even fluid dynamic books really get this specific and just generalize that point.","score":3.4339872045}

So I've heard this many times before in the context of astronomy and JWST and I realized that I don't quite understand the implications of this statement: \"we perceive infrared as heat\". Our eyes see visible light frequencies, we have detectors that capture this visible light emitted from far away and our brains process it and that's how we see the environment around us. But about our perception of infrared as \"heat\":\n\n* Stars\/flames that burn hotter appear blue, stars that are colder appear red. Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes? Since infrared is heat and blue stars are hotter, I would expect more infrared from blue stars. Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red? Or is \"heat\" and \"hot temperature\" not actually the same thing in this case?\n* Our skin \"feels\" infrared as \"heat\". But does our skin only detect infrared by direct contact, so we have to be touching something to feel that it's \"hot\" and tense its temperature? Or does it also detect some infrared radiation going through vacuum\/air? When we feel the heat from a glowing red heater for example, do we feel the infrared radiation emitted directly by the hot metal, or do we feel the direct contact with the hot air that was heated by this nearby element and traveled to us across the room?\n* Infrared cameras see \"heat\" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat\/IR?\n* When our skin feels infrared, is it only sensitive to a certain part of the infrared spectrum? Does the infrared range our skin feels correspond to a small range of IR frequencies which correspond to a range of temperatures, that happen to be a \"safe\" range for our bodies to come in contact with? For example, when something feels \"very cold\" is that just a signal for our brain that any colder is dangerous, and what feels \"very hot\" tells our brain that any hotter is also dangerous?

I read somewhere that this relationship is obtained in the context of assuming that the electron's velocity distribution in a plasma is a temperature distribution. But this should apply to everyday situations, right? Like for example in justifying why Cooper pairs are unable to form at room temperature (because the bond energy is like 0.001 eV, which by the relationship above is about 11.6 K). But if a semiconductor has a bandgap of 2 eV, by the same relationship, you should expect that you need to heat it to like 24000 K in order for it to promote electrons to the conduction band.

Ok, so a while back, I had an argument with a professor of mine about how evolution works.\n\n I supported that evolution is the fact that random mutations occur to offsprings, which happen to be beneficial for the environment they live in, so they are more fit at surviving at that environment. Leading for easier reproduction for the individuals with that mutation, causing the mutation to prevail.  While the environment itself was not the cause of the mutation.\n\nMy professor said the the mutation occurred because of the external environment, and that they were not random. The example he gave me was that if a guy played the guitar from a young age, his fingers would get longer, so he would be more fit to play the guitar. So after a few generations, if his kids played the guitar also, they would create a family line with long fingers.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nEDIT: He is not a biology professor.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you to anyone who replied and sent me PMS.

Why aren't velocities added, it doesn't make any sense to me.\nI'm not asking how light is observed or if planet A would observe planet B at 0.96c, i'm asking what is the physical location and velocity of the planets relative to each other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Premise 2:**\nNow let's say we are on Planet D, and we will use Planet D as the stationary reference point. Planets A and B start right beside us, Then suddenly both Planets shoot off in opposite directions at 0.75c each.\n\n1 Year of Time has passed and now Planet A is exactly 0.75 LightYears of Distance away from us (Planet D)... and also Planet B is 0.75 LightYears in the opposite direction. correct???\nSo now Planet A and B are exactly 1.5 LightYears apart after 1 Year of Time???\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow let's ignore Planet D and have a ride on planet A instead. After 1 Year of Time Planet B is now 1.5 LightYears away from us (Planet A), so surely that means Planet B was travelling at 1.5c relative to Planet A??? If they are 1.5 LightYears apart, then surely Planet B was truly travelling at a velocity of 1.5c relative to Planet A.... otherwise how would they be 1.5 LightYears apart.\n\nSo onto the title question again, if the Planets crashed into each other, then wouldn't Planet B impact Planet A at the true velocity of 1.5c and not 0.96c ??? Again I am not asking how Planet A observes the speed of light or observes Planet B. I am asking what the true velocity and physical location of the Planets are relative to each other. \n\nSo if the answer is 0.96c, then doesn't that mean Premise 2 is incorrect and after 1 Year of time, A and B would be 0.96 Light years apart and not 1.5?\n\nThanks for reading.","score":0.0}

However, Alice can't send a message to Bob -- time and space are flipped in a black hole, meaning that sending a message outward inside a black hole is like us sending a message backward in time outside a black hole.\n\nSo, she can't talk to Bob. But can the neurons in the front of her head send messages to the back of her head? My feeling is \"no\". So, at this point, there is no possible discussion of what an observer would view inside a black hole, since there is no way to maintain consciousness of any form inside a black hole.\n\nThat's my current handwavy hypothesis, and I'm wondering if there are any papers to read on the topic.

We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST \/ 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http:\/\/www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!\n\n-----\n\nLinks:\n\n* [YouTube Announcement](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c7293kAiPZw)\n* [LIGO](http:\/\/www.ligo.org\/news\/media-advisory.php)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by Discovery](http:\/\/news.discovery.com\/space\/what-you-need-to-know-about-gravitational-waves-160210.htm)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics](http:\/\/www.phdcomics.com\/comics.php?f=1853)\n\n-----\n\nFAQ:\n\n> Where do they come from?\n\nThe source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). \n\n> How fast do they go?\n\nGravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Speed_of_gravity)).\n\n> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?\n\nThe 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PSR_B1913%2B16).\n\nIn 2014, the [BICEP2](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.\n\n> Does this mean we can control gravity?\n\nNo. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http:\/\/www.tapir.caltech.edu\/~teviet\/Waves\/gwave_spectrum.html).\n\n> What's the practical application?\n\n[Here](http:\/\/stuver.blogspot.com\/2012\/01\/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.\n\n> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons?

Is this actually how radiation works? To provide some examples for people who haven't seen the show (spoilers ahead, be warned):\n\n1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.\n\n2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety. It is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus \"absorbing\" the radiation and dying immediately after birth.\n\n**Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.\n\nIs Chernobyl's portrayal of person-to-person radiation contamination *that* sensationalized?

{"title":"How are we able to perform a body transplant when we can't repair spinal injuries?","full_text":"How are we able to perform a body transplant when we can't repair spinal injuries? So as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted \"head transplant\" is scheduled to occur later this year. I haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves\/veins\/etc, and the spine. However to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?\n\nEdit: so this blew up quite a bit. For the record, I am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, I simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.\n\nI am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what I'm asking about. \n\nI do believe a body transplant is something we could one day achieve, just not yet. Eventually someone has to try, and that's what this is to me. This year's failure could led to next year's success","score":9.4393069366}

{"title":"AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!","full_text":"AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything! An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https:\/\/www.eso.org\/public\/news\/eso2015\/\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect\/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways\/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.\n\nThe inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:\n\nCan someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? Why or Why not?","score":9.0828478515}

I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg\/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age\/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). \n\nAnd huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these \"because fat is bad\" useless and\/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. \n\nAnd yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).","score":9.0780653327}
