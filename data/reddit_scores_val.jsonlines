{"title":"Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?","full_text":"Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces? I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: \n\n**1. The Moon**\n\n>u\/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/338\/6110\/1047\/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/294\/5541\/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.\n\n **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**\n\n> u\/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2019\/01\/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2019\/01\/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  \n>  \n>u\/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth\u2019s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https:\/\/eos.org\/articles\/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0012821X19300202). \n\n**3. Moldavite \u2013 Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**\n\n> u\/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https:\/\/www.arkadiancollection.com\/what-is-moldavite](https:\/\/www.arkadiancollection.com\/what-is-moldavite) \n\n**4. Hydrogen and Helium** \n\n>u\/SlowerThanLightSpeed: \"Jean's escape\" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmospheric\\_escape#Jeans\\_Escape](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   \n>  \n>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg\/s of hydrogen.\\[10\\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g\/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\\[10\\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\\[11\\] \n\n**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** \n\n>u\/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a \"supervolcano\" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http:\/\/volcano.oregonstate.edu\/ozone-destruction](http:\/\/volcano.oregonstate.edu\/ozone-destruction) \n>\n>u\/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km\/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

{"title":"Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?","full_text":"Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down? PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING\n\nThis is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. \n\nBut Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. \n\nSo is force really mass x acceleration?

My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA! I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http:\/\/tiny.ucsf.edu\/7uNbjg\n\nMy lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. \n\nBy producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.\n\n\nI'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!\n\nEDIT: I am signing off now, thank you for all the thoughtful questions and comments! \n\n\n","score":8.8861326182}

{"title":"Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations?","full_text":"Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations? I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.\n\nI'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like \"if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?\" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a \"hide\" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?\n\nIt seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \\*where\\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and \"why\" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?\n\nEDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. \n\nPrecisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you \/u\/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.\n\nI didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a \"hiding\" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction\/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. \n\nHowever, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting\/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \\~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt\/rest cycle \\~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to \"learn\" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions\/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","score":8.8533796729}

A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.\n\n* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.\n\n* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck.

I'm aware that if you were to approach a black hole, your speed relative to someone watching from afar would increase greatly, thus your time from their perspective would appear to slow down until you reach the event horizon, where you would freeze in place for eternity. In this sense, as your personal time is moving so much slower than all of that around you, would you not see the future of the universe unravel before you, just as you cross the event horizon?","score":8.8299580442}

AUA about our open data! Hi \/r\/AskScience!\n\nAs the title of the \/r\/technology post said, we [dropped 300 Terabytes of LHC data to the internet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/technology\/comments\/4g3xvx\/cern_just_dropped_300_terabytes_of_raw_collider\/) a month ago via the [CERN Open Data Portal](http:\/\/opendata.cern.ch). The data, from the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](http:\/\/cms.web.cern.ch) Experiment, are now in the public domain under the CC0 waiver. The datasets include over 100 TB of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. The data are provided in the format that is used by CMS scientists for performing physics analyses. We have also provided 200 TB of simulated data (*Monte Carlo*) generated with the same software version that should be used to analyse the primary datasets. [Read more about the data release.](http:\/\/cms.web.cern.ch\/news\/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc)\n\nA year and a half ago, when we first launched the CERN Open Data Portal, we conducted an [AMA about the first release of open data on the portal and about open science in general](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IAmA\/comments\/2nxwkb\/a_few_days_ago_cern_launched_an_open_data_portal\/).

{"title":"Does gravity have a range or speed?","full_text":"Does gravity have a range or speed? So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km\/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is \"new gravity\" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?\n\nI realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.\n\nEdit:  I did not expect this question to blow up like this, this is amazing.

As I understand it, this is evolutionarily almost inevitable: if a strain has a mutation that makes it more transmissible, it should generally outcompete less transmissible variants until it becomes dominant (exceptions being 1) if it is substantially more lethal such that it kills people before they can spread it, but this hasn't been a factor for Covid-19, and 2) if a variant is better able to overcome prior immunity, it may become dominant even if it doesn't have an inherent transmissibility advantage). This happened with Alpha, then Delta, the Omicron, etc. \n\nThe implication seems to be that infectious diseases should have evolutionary pressures almost constantly pushing them towards greater infectiousness. \n\nHowever (to my understanding), the flu hasn't inevitably gotten more infectious over time.

The idea is that in an infinite amount of time, a monkey would type out the complete works of Shakespeare(it could be any book of course). \n\nI'm having a hard time of believing it to be true. I think I accept the premise  that given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen, will happen. But I'm not sure if I think that a monkey typing out characters in a way that a book is written in is something that can happen. \n\nMy argument is that because the way a monkey's brains work is not like some kind of randomness-machine, and that means you will not have every possible combination, you will tend to see patterns, even very vague patterns that are so vague and unordered that it will seem like randomness, but isn't really completely random. \n\nIn other words I'm arguing that maybe (and it would be dumb to say that I'm sure of this) the possible character combinations for a monkey is actually limited, and not infinite. Which means even if the time is infinite, you will still not see character combinations outside the limit of what the monkey can write. \n\n**EDIT: Ok, so people have said to me that it's just a mathematical construct. Which means, it's not true: Monkeys can't write the complete works of Shakespeare in an inifnite amount of time.**\n\n**What is true then is that something like a randomness machine, which is typing keys randomly at a typewriter, would eventually write any book that's ever existed, given enough time. Which is by the way not similar to monkeys at all, so don't tell me monkeys is a good metaphor for understanding this, it would be better to just drop the metaphor and used something that actually applies to a real scenario then.**\n\nOk, so I understand now, you don't have to tell me how confused I am any longer. I just think using monkeys is quite dumb to explaining something like this because it's so far from how it would have worked in real life, and that is my opinion, and both me and your mummy doesn't give a single shit about your disagreement with my subjective opinion. \n\nOr if you still think I'm saying something factually wrong here, be my guest to explain what I'm not getting.","score":0.0}

{"title":"Does an individual molecule move like a classical point particle?","full_text":"Does an individual molecule move like a classical point particle? My understanding is that individual sub-atomic or elementary particles such as electrons \"jump\" from place to place within a given area without crossing the space in between. I don't know what the term is so I'll just call this \"quantum behavior\/motion\". I also have read about the concept of coherence where the more elementary particles in the system and the more interaction between the particles, the less the overall system exhibits this quantum behavior i.e. when things get big enough they instead exhibit \"classical motion\" like a pool ball moving through every point on the table from cue to pocket. If this premise is correct then I am curious how large\/complex a system has to be in order to cross the threshold from quantum motion to classical motion.

And since the comments are misunderstanding it is further reason to elaborate.\n\nA coil spring seems like a hybrid of a torsion spring and a flexion spring. Flexion spring: think safety pin or leaf spring. Torsion spring: think paper clip. \n\nAs a coil spring extends it becomes more sensitive to flexion and less sensitive to torsion. As it compresses it becomes more sensitive to torsion and less sensitive to flexion.  \n\nSo with the shape of the Slinky, it is easily deformed near its compressed state since it is sensitive to torsion. When it moves to its extended state the spring is more sensitive to flexion (on one axis) and so is harder to deform. \n\nDo engineers talk about springs like this?","score":1.6094379124}

Hi everyone, I've been googling for a while and can't find an answer that takes into account both scenarios. \n\nSay you have a brushed DC motor acting as a generator and you can connect different loads to it (10 ohms, 100ohms, 5ohms...) but you cannot control the input (like the wind). How does this affect both the mechanical output power AND the electric output power?\nI'm thinking of renewable energy, and usually when in numerical modeling, mechanical power is used as Pmech =c*w^2 (damping times speed). With a higher electrical resistance as the load, the speed lowers but you have a higher damping value. If you were to graph this there is some \"knee\" of optimal damping to yield highest mechanical power.\nBut what happens with electrical power? With a higher load, the generator would move slower, and produce less voltage. So wouldn't we have Pelec = V^(2)\/R, where V is lower and R is high, creating an overall low electric power?\nThank you!","score":1.6094379124}

Optimal ignition requires exact proportions of fuel and air (oxygen source).\n\nCould there be a threshold where pushing pedal injects so much fuel that it starts to take up so much space that could be used for air that in result it decreases power output?\n\nIs there any truth to my thoughts?

[500 Women Scientists](http:\/\/500womenscientists.org\/) is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.\n\n500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from [small groups, not large crowds](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/11\/what-successful-movements-have-in-common). Our [Local Pods](https:\/\/500womenscientists.org\/take-action\/#pods) help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.\n\nWith us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.\n\n1. Wendy Bohon (Dr_Wendy) - Hi, I'm Dr. Wendy Bohon! My research focuses on examining how the surface and near surface of the earth changes as the result of earthquakes. I also work on improving public education and perception of science, particularly seismology and earthquake hazards. I'm a woman, a scientist, a mother and a proud member of 500 Women Scientists!\n\n2. Hi, I'm [Kelly Fleming](https:\/\/kellylfleming.com\/), AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and co-leader of 500 Women Scientists. I firmly believe that for science to serve all of society, it must be accessible to diverse people - including underrepresented minorities, immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA people. Although I don't do research anymore, my Ph.D. is in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, where I studied reactions that help turn plant material into fuels. \n\n3. Tessa Hill - I am [Tessa Hill](http:\/\/hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com\/), an oceanographer at UC Davis, based at [Bodega Marine Laboratory](http:\/\/bml.ucdavis.edu\/).  I study impacts of climate change on the ocean, including ocean acidification, which is a chemical change occurring in the ocean due to our carbon dioxide emissions. I am excited to be working with 500 Women Scientists to encourage a diverse, inclusive and thriving scientific community.  You can find me on Twitter (@Tessa_M_Hill) and our lab Facebook page https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/oceanbiogeochemistry\n\n4. Monica Mugnier (MonicaMugnier) - Hi, I'm Dr. Monica Mugnier.

My lab studies how African trypanosomes, the parasites that cause African sleeping sickness, hide from our immune systems. You can read about our work in more detail at [www.mugnierlab.org](http:\/\/www.mugnierlab.org\/). When I am not pondering parasites, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make the scientific community a more welcoming place for everyone. \n\n5. Kathleen Ritterbush - Hi, I'm Dr. Kathleen Ritterbush, Assistant Professor of paleontology at the University of Utah. My students and I study mass extinctions and ecosystem changes of sea animals from the time of the dinosaurs and earlier. I believe science careers should include all kinds of people, engage our communities, and support work-life balance.\n\n6. Hi there, I'm a planetary volcanologist. I study the physics of volcanic processes on the Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars using combinations of satellite data, field work, and laboratory experiments. I'm currently transitioning from a position as a postdoctoral fellow at a public university to one at a federal agency.
