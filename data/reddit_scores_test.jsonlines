Maybe because of that it allowed the virus with high transmission rate to survive better than virus that have low transmission rate.

{"title":"Why are ionization energies so much larger than electron affinities?","full_text":"Why are ionization energies so much larger than electron affinities? As I understand it, the ionization energy is the energy required to take an electron away, off of an atom. Electron affinity, on the other hand is kind of the opposite, as it's the amount of energy given off when an electron is given to an atom. As such, I thought they'd be similar in terms of value.\n\nI've been looking at charts of electron affinity and first ionization energies, and it seems that that's not the case, however. For example, hydrogen has an ionization energy of 1312 kJ\/mol... but an electron affinity of only 73 kJ\/mol. What's up with that? The electron affinity is less than a tenth of the ionization energy. Both values deal in putting\/removing an electron around the hydrogen atom... why does the change in energy vary so much? This doesn't seem to just be hydrogen, either, as even the lowest first ionization energy (Fr, ~380 kJ\/mol) is larger than the largest electron affinity (Cl ~349 kJ\/mol).\n\nI've been trying to understand this and in looking further I've only gotten more confused by looking at standard enthalpy of formation too... If I want to make a mole of NaCl, I'd have to take a mole of Na, and a mole of Cl, and move the electron from every Na atom to a Cl one, right? So that's 496 kJ\/mol to take the electrons off of Na, and 349 kJ\/mol back when I give them to Cl, so I guessed that this whole process should take 147 kJ. But the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl is about -411 kJ\/mol, which means its an exothermic reaction. Where is this additional ~558 kJ\/mol coming from?\n\nApologies if my understanding of these concepts is wrong... but could someone possibly explain why it is this way?","score":1.3862943611}

Biochars and post processing [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YB9g9l5CjGk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YB9g9l5CjGk)\n\nCharcoals have polar surfaces with tremendous numbers of nooks and crannies and are found ubiquitously in the world's soils deposited from fire. These legacy structures modulate soil fertility, individual plant response, and subsequent large-scale ecosystem patterns.\n\nIn recent years, incredible attention has been paid to their use as a soil amendment - converting waste biomass into charcoals, \"biochars\" - dually capturing carbon and increasing soil fertility in managed ecosystems. Most data synthesis, including my own with Dr. Sean Thomas at Toronto, show on average \\~41% increase in biomass responses.\n\nSource: [https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11056-015-9491-7](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11056-015-9491-7)\n\nHowever, much variation ensues from the applied usage in agricultural and forestry contexts - including negative responses. The mechanisms that drive these detrimental effects are many. Still, research shows that low molecular weight leachates (i.e., acids, phenols, VOCs), Ash, and sometimes metals could be responsible for a mismatch in soil physiochemistry.

However, there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations. \n\nFor example, the people who historically populated and continue to populate the Himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates, helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes. \n\nFurthermore, the peoples of Central Africa have a specialized susceptibility to Sickle-Celled Anaemia, which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors. \n\nEven the Germanic people of Northern Europe are in their own way specialized, having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world, thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase. \n\nThese populations standing as examples, I believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates (prior to today's heavily interconnected society) into human taxonomical subspecies, and I wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not. \n\nIf the mods think this question is best placed in another subreddit please, by all means let me know and I will post it there instead.

So, this is going to be my first reddit post, and hopefully you guys and gals can help me out.\n\nThe other day I heard a noise coming from my computer, it was the warning alert indicating that someone on the internet was wrong. I therefore engaged in a brief discussion with someone who advocates Geocentrism. Never having been exposed to this seriously outside of history classes about Galileo\/Copernicus, and having a computer science background, I didn't feel well equipped to debate this strident person, who was apparently free of any doubt.\n\nStill curious, however, I have since been trying to figure out what the consensus is on the data re:geocentrism.\n\nAs far as I could understand, he's stating that the [MM experiments](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michelson-Morley_experiment), the [CMB data from WMAP and SSDS](http:\/\/magisterialfundies.blogspot.com\/2012\/09\/newest-observational-evidence-shows.html), and just recently the [Planck data](http:\/\/magisterialfundies.blogspot.com\/2013\/03\/copernican-principle-1532-2013-rip-why.html) all point to the Earth as being a privileged, non-relativistic frame.\n\nI've checked out [Plait's response](http:\/\/blogs.discovermagazine.com\/badastronomy\/2010\/09\/14\/geocentrism-seriously\/#.UUycXhxwpOg) to some non-specific Geocentrist claims, and incedentally Delano's [friend's response to it](http:\/\/www.galileowaswrong.com\/galileowaswrong\/features\/5.pdf).\n\nI have also watched the 4 [extant videos created by CHL](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wyRJZbNmC7U#!), as well as various wikipedia\/rationalwiki pages etc...\n\nBut I was hoping for specific refutations of the things linked above, MMX and CMB information. I realize that this guy is a fundamentalist, and as such isn't susceptible to the kind of reason that sways me, but I would like to get a better grasp on the size and scope of his wrongness. \n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo, first of all, thanks to all those who took the time and effort to give responses to my original questions, many of them were very informative. As my first experience posting on askscience, and reddit in general, this has gone better than it could have.\n\nNext; an apology.\n\nI was originally thinking of posting these questions in one of the atheism, debate religion, or philosophy subs, but in the end I went with askScience because I figured there would be more experts in the relevant Astronomy\/Astrophysics\/Physics subjects here.\n\nI arrived at these questions through my interactions with religious people on their blogs. I had never encounter a modern-day geocentrist before, and so was unwilling to continue discussing the points he made with the little information I had at my disposal at the time. Not having NdGT's, Kaku's, Hawking's or Plait's numbers on hand anymore, I thought I might try to get these questions answered here.\n\nI then made the mistake of linking directly to that person's blog in my OP, which I am assuming is to blame for his incredibly quick arrival at this thread. I hope that the distinction is clear between my OP, looking for factual information about real data and theory, and the person who later made an appearance here. My training is as a computer scientist, and though I was contemplating copy-pastaing the blog-points which I eventually linked to, something about the unnecessary duplication of a wall o' text verbatim is nails\/chalkboard to me. I realize now that there may have been unforeseen negatives to that decision, which would have made it worth while to spend the time.\n\nI've noted the shocked tone of some of the original responses, followed by frustration and eventually dismissal. I personally feel that any and all questions are healthy and important to ask, so long as one is willing and capable of accepting the best answers provided by reason and evidence, so I sympathize.\n\nWhether or not this thread eventually devolved into more noise than signal is obviously up to you to decide, but for my part I got some questions answered, and I suppose I got to eat some popcorn while an intellectual train wreck occurred in front of me.\n\nI will attempt to collect a quick list of the information that I've learned as a result of this, and post it below.","score":0.6931471806}

In the photoelectric effect experiment the saturation current depends on the intensity of light that's because intensity is what determines the number of electrons emitted per unit time from the cathode surface...\nNow here's the problem... This saturation current doesn't depend on frequency. Equal intensity radiation of different frequency result in the same saturation current. Which means the same number of electrons are emitted per unit time if we have same intensity... But but but, because the frequency of radiation is different, it means the electrons will carry different energies, more in the case where frequency is more than when it's less. But how is this possible? Same intensity radiation means energy is fed into the systems at equal rates. Then how can the electrons in one case have more energy than the other?","score":1.3862943611}

And so to correctly represent the universe, you'd need a mechanism which represents yes\/no. The best I could come up with was elections which have a up or down spin with one representing 1, the other representing 0. However, in such a system, the amount of electrons would be insufficient to represent the information necessary to simulate our universe assuming that the 'real' universe is the size of our universe and has the same laws of physics\/particles.\n\nWith only electron spin, though, you could store only the up or down spin of the electron in the simulation, so the best you could simulate is a universe with an equivalent amount of electrons, but only their spin all at once. Nothing about their location, velocity, size, charge.  \n\nThen I realized that what I'm describing isn't really how the universe works. There's uncertainty. Einstein says that God Doesn't Play Dice, and the consensus I've always seen is that he's actually wrong about that. \n\nSo, could things like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, spooky action at a distance, and electron clouds which are represented by probability functions, just be data\/power saving measures?","score":0.0}

My textbook says\n\n>As paleomagnetists sampled and measured older and older rocks, **their results seemed to show that the north magnetic pole was far from the modern pole and appeared to wander through time**. This was called the \u201cpolar wander hypothesis\u201d at first. But then they ran into a problem. Each continent had a completely different polar wander curve, which only converged on a common magnetic pole today. These data seemed to suggest that the magnetic field had behaved very strangely in the past, with multiple directions of magnetic north that no longer exist. As outrageous as that  idea seemed, the only alternative was just as radical: **the continents had moved through time, so it was not the magnetic pole that was changing but the continents** **that recorded their directions**. But when you lined up the polar wander curves for two different continents, like Europe and North America, you found that they matched once you moved  the continents back together as Wegener had suggested. **In other words, the \u201cpolar wander curves\u201d were only apparent polar wander curves because it was the continents that moved, not the magnetic poles.**\n\nWhat I'm confused about is my book saying, \"the continents had moved through time, so it was *not the magnetic pole that was changing*\" because isn't that not completely true since magnetic North DOES move? We've observed this movement, so isn't my book completely dismissing the idea of a \"wandering pole\" incorrect?\n\nEverything I've watched and read online only talks about the effect of continental drift on the apparent wander curves, but they haven't talked about how the magnetic North pole does, in fact, move.

This is a question in my boyfriend's physics textbook. The closest I've ever come to studying physics was two months during my senior year of high school where my statistics class dipped our toes into the wild world of differential calculus, so I have no idea what answer the book is expecting. I'm sure, though, that the methods they are expecting him to use to answer the question don't take anything as silly as \"reality\" into account--you know, like the fact that for this scenario to happen at all, you would have to be wearing a heavily padded space suit. Or else you'd be too busy with your rupturing organs to kick anything on purpose.\n\nSo, here's what I'm looking for: what answer will I find in the back of the textbook if I look, why is that the case, and can you explain it like I'm 5? I thought about posting this there but I figured I'd find more physics-types here.\n\n**EDIT**: This is why I love reddit: 6-deep nested comment threads bickering over the definition of \"weightless.\" I do admit that I didn't immediately think of the ISS when I saw the question, haha.

Is this true? What are some examples of this? You made a mistake with your food -- you left it out too long, or cooked it at too low a temperature. But it's not salvageable. You have to toss it, because while re-cooking it properly may kill bacteria, it won't remove the \"toxins\" they could have produced.\n\nI've seen this many times over the years and it always seems like folk wisdom that's repeated without a complete understanding. I've never seen an example of what these toxins may be or what contaminants may produce them.\n\nSuppose some meat was left at room temperature for 24 hours, well outside the FDA \"danger zone\" (40 to 140 \u00b0F for more than 2 hours). If that meat is then thoroughly cooked at high temperatures for an extended period of time, what specific risks remain? \n\nI would guess there are also factors involving bacterial population... i.e., eradicating a large population of E. Coli that grew over 24 hours is maybe more difficult than killing a smaller infection. But I'm specifically interested in the idea that bacteria or other parasites may produce byproducts that go on to survive a thorough cooking.","score":2.8903717579}

After he is done flipping, he will look at the flips that\r\nimmediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those\r\nflips. Because the coin is fair, Jack of course expects this empirical probability of heads to be equal\r\nto the true probability of flipping a heads: 0.5. Shockingly, Jack is wrong. If he were to sample one\r\nmillion fair coins and flip each coin 4 times, observing the conditional relative frequency for each\r\ncoin, on average the relative frequency would be approximately 0.4\"\nChecked in spreadsheet with randomly generated 0 and 1 4 times in a row and it's really turns out probabilty of 2 consequential tosses be heads is 0.2 not 0.25 as one could expected.

For example: \n\n* An article by a chemistry Professor: [https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2020\/mar\/12\/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2020\/mar\/12\/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants)\n* A podcast with a physician: [https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/radio\/programs\/coronacast\/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus\/12134820](https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/radio\/programs\/coronacast\/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus\/12134820)\n* And the Mayo Clinic: [https:\/\/newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org\/discussion\/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus\/](https:\/\/newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org\/discussion\/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus\/)\n\nSome claim it is indeed the most effective method.\n\nThe claim is that the virus has a lipid layer, and therefore soap or detergent will interfere with that layer and is therefore a highly effective way of destroying the virus.\n\nHowever, I have not been able to find any actual research to back this claim.  \n\nThe only study I have found that tested this is here: [https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanmic\/article\/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3](https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanmic\/article\/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3\/fulltext#sec1)\n\nIn that study, they compared several disinfectants, including hand soap.  Out of all tested, hand soap was the only disinfectant found to still have active virus after 5 minutes.  That is, it was the worst performer.\n\nThe CDC lists disinfectants believed to be effective against the virus, but not included in that list is detergent.  In their recommendations the suggest using detergent or soap followed by a disinfectant:\n\n>If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\n\n[https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/prevent-getting-sick\/cleaning-disinfection.html](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/prevent-getting-sick\/cleaning-disinfection.html)\n\nTo be clear, I am not asking whether washing your hands with soap is effective, as I understand there is plenty of good evidence for this.  My understanding is that the mechanism of action is to physically remove the virus from your hands, rather than to inactivate it.  My question is about whether soap is an effective way of destroying the virus on surfaces as claimed in the above articles.\n\nIs there evidence to support this claim?","score":1.0986122887}

At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter\/energy) acted, but only the particles were \"real\" (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as \"spin\" is an abstract concept.\n\nAt which point was it decided that \"the field(s)\" is a real physical entity? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s\/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical\/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.\n\nAnd there's no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field.

{"title":"Does Plan B have post-fertilization effects?","full_text":"Does Plan B have post-fertilization effects? Hi everyone! I have been doing a lot of research recently on the way that Plan B works and have happened upon a lot of mixed information. According to a lot of current research, Plan B has been proven to have no post-fertilization effects specifically regarding an alteration of the endrometrium. However, I also happened upon a fairly recent article:\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5102184\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5102184\/)\n\nThat claims the following: \"The mechanism of action of LNG-EC is reviewed. The drug has no ability to alter sperm function at doses used *in vivo* and has limited ability to suppress ovulation. Our analysis estimates that the drug's ovulatory inhibition potential could prevent less than 15 percent of potential conceptions, thus making a pre-fertilization mechanism of action significantly less likely than previously thought. Luteal effects (such as decreased progesterone, altered glycodelin levels, and shortened luteal phase) present in the literature may suggest a pre-ovulatory induced post-fertilization drug effect.\"\n\nThe evidence seems pretty compelling to point towards the fact that pre-fertilization effects of the drug are not the sole method of pregnancy prevention, or even the most common method. As someone who believes that life begins at conception, this is troubling for me. I took a Plan B thinking it would have no adverse affects on a potential embryo that had already formed in me, and then I experienced bleeding the next few days which made me want to research more into Plan B's potential to act as an abortifacient.\n\nTL:DR: Research surrounding Plan B is highly contested, but articles such as the one above suggest that Plan B has post-fertilization effects. As someone who believes that life begins at conception this is troubling since many other sources are spreading the idea that Plan B poses no threat to an embryo. What are your thoughts on this?

But surely if I'm moving away at the same speed the light is (both constant speeds), then the first bit of light might hit my eye, but after that there is no distance being made between the light and my eye since both are the same constant speed (for example 2 cars travelling in front of each other in the same direction at the same speed would never actually hit). Surely nothing would be hitting my eye anymore.\n\nWhat am I missing here?\n\n**I have heard a lot that time dilation is just perspective, just like when I mentioned above, time seemed to be frozen due to moving away from the clock at the speed of light.**\n\nWhat I also don't get about this is that, time 'seems' to be frozen, however this is just because the light is not given the chance to hit my retina, surely that's just a visual effect.

(but both compared tho which reference point? Could you take just one of the two starting points?) And when they meet, would it's speed effectively be \"zero\" on one of the planets, and double the \"speed\" that both are moving on the other planet?\n\nIf so, then if the chain is long enough, why wouldn't they be able to reach a \"speed\" faster than light when they collide or closely pass each other?\n\nIn this entire story and theory, I just have to get back to the point that speed is a funny thing because of reference points etc. and you could totally say it's very relative. If it's relative then how can we claim light to be the fastest thing?\n\nAlso, how do we \"know\" it's the fastest thing? Is it just because we just don't know of anything that is faster?(which would be very stupid reasoning in my book) Or is there some solid math behind this?\n\n\nOn a related point, if galaxies are moving towards each other, these would have immense speed as well, but if light as the absolute highest speed, what would possibly be the thing that is limiting the speed of galaxies? and compared to *what*? What could possibly be limiting a huge galaxy that is floating in nothingness?","score":1.6094379124}

I'm sorry, I know this question isn't as intellectually stimulating as most of the stuff posted here, but it's relevant to my interests. I ran several searches beforehand, but while there were a lot of pot-related questions, this didn't seem to be one of them. \n\nOn this [forum ](http:\/\/buymarijuanaseeds.com\/community\/threads\/pre-baking-marijuana.114442\/)**(NSFW)**, and many others, there appears to be a school of thought that baking marijuana at relatively low temperatures - prior to smoking - activates more of the THC.\n\nThe reasoning boils down to this sentence: \n\n>In whole-plant cannabis, THC content is expressed as THCA (tetrahydrocannabolic acid) prior to decarboxylation into THC, which takes place when cannabis is heated during cooking, and smoked or vaporized ingestion. THCA is a mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory but does not have good affinity with our CB1 receptors...\n\nWhile I'm familiar with marijuana vaporization, this seems to be something different. Traditionally vaporized pot is less potent afterwards, not more. Naturally, marijuana user forums are not known for the their rigorous citation, so I can't find any evidence aside from \"I tried it and it totally worked.\" I realize this question is vulnerable to all sorts of layman speculation, but I'm hoping to avoid that. \n\nIs there any scientific evidence for the statement, or is it just the usual stoner superstition?","score":1.0986122887}

Maybe some sort of system with extremely low losses? So low that the spring is retracted to almost the same height as it started from. I know there would be a ton of calculations to get the spring to return just as the hooks were returning back ot their original position , just wondering if this is possible. In my head if the losses were extremely small to the point you could barely even see the losses this would be possible because the hooks would recapture the spring replacing the energy lost to friction and piercing of the skin , but i have minimal knowledge of physics & engineering and wanted to ask the experts.\n\nNot trying to design a reusable lancet.

In Fourier's paper on Earth's climate, he says that the earth gains heat through mostly visible light from the sun and loses it more slowly though IR radiation. He says that this is because the slower IR rays have a more difficult time passing through clear bodies in the atmosphere than visible light (which I kinda assumed was because IR moves more slowly than visible light), and upon contact with the opaque surface of the earth, the visible light is converted to IR. But I read recently that infrared can pass through dense gasses, some of which are even opaque - I understand that since it came out in the early 1800's, Fourier's paper is a little outdated\n\nSo is he wrong? Can IR pass through thick dust and gas, but not the atmosphere? If so, why? From what I've read, the resonance structure of CO2 absorbs infrared but if that's why, why does de Saussure's box (a few panes of glass above a black cork body placed in the sunlight, leading to intensely heated chambers) have the same effect? (also, how is visible light converted to IR upon contact with opaque bodies?)\n\nSorry if this question is written badly or stupid, I'm a dumb plant & soil science sophomore\n\nEDIT: My sister's really smart and she says it's because some IR still escapes, even if most of it is absorbed and re-emitted in a random direction, while most visible light will not be able to pass through something opaque.

There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression. \nFacts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).\n\nHe doesn't really say if it's a huge reason why those acts happen or if its just a factor. Also it seems odd since last I checked there wasn't any epidemic of robberies and assault done in the name of video games. Or is it the same old, oh this person played violent video games and robbed someone\/attacked someone, clearly the video games were on of the main reasons! I don't see my friends going around robbing people or attacking them. Sure some people do it, but isn't because its violent video games on top of being already mentally aggressive and having a troubled youth? Also the whole delinquency angle sounds strange to me, is there any merit to that claim outside of his own study?\n\nAnother statement he makes that I find odd: Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing. \nFacts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.\n\nPay attention to this \"Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.\" He stated that video games have been linked to robbery and assault, but says it is only a small factor now. It sounds like he was trying to make video games sound WAY worse than they really are. Also what annoys me about this whole article, is that it doesn't touch on the subject of do video games directly make people violent. As in if I don't have other risk factors or I have very few, could video games alone make me into a violent person?\n\nAnyways thanks to whoever has read this, if you are a professional on this type of stuff I would really appreciate an answer\/perspective. Thanks in advance!\n\n\nEdit: Another claim he made in a testimony to the senate: Myth 2. Violent media have harmful effects only on a very small minority of people who use these media. One version of this myth is commonly generated by parents who allow their children to watch violent movies and play violent games. It generally sounds like this, \"My 12 year old son watches violent TV shows, goes to violent movies, and plays violent video games, and he's never killed anyone.\" Of course, most people who consume high levels of violent media, adults or youth, do not end up in prison for violent crimes. Most smokers do not die of lung cancer, either. The more relevant question is whether many (or most) people become more angry, aggressive, and violent as a result of being exposed to high levels of media violence. Are they more likely to slap a child or spouse when provoked? Are they more likely to drive aggressively, and display \"road rage?\" Are they more likely to assault co-workers? The answer is a clear yes.\n\nWhere is the evidence for this clear yes? I never slapped a child or any of my family members. I never assaulted a co-worker. Only person I ever fought were bullies who harassed me. And I am pretty sure most people if they got bullied a lot would retaliate. Its not uncommon at all...","score":4.248495242}

Since the earth's tilt will be completely tilted in the opposite direction every \\~13k years, we can expect summer to be in January in the northern hemisphere in the year 15,020 CE.  However, we should be able to see a continual shift in the date of the seasons as the earth's tilt precesses.  So, I was thinking:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Half the precession of the equinox is \\~13k years\n2. 13k years to shift summer to winter (roughly 180 day      shift of the seasons)\n3. 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600      years.\n4.

A person who had lack of sleep and dreams for 4 months, of which there are only a few minutes of nightly hallucinations, can turn out to read newspapers during the day, make plans, play cards and win, and at the same time lie on the bed in the dark all night without sleep! In conclusion, we admit: this observation makes most theories about the functions of sleep and paradoxical (REM) sleep obsolete at once, but offers nothing else\u201d ([Jouvet, 2016](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8058214\/#B26)). \"\n\n[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8058214\/](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8058214\/)\n\nIs this true in a literal way? can a mammal survive without the state known as Sleep, or only under certain neurological conditions?","score":2.9444389792}

Is this because of the T symmetry of the weak force?\n\nAs for Gamma ray bursts\n\nDo we know the actual mechanism of how they form? I mean, something more profound than the formation of a blackhole due to the collapse of a star or merge\/collision.\n\nWhere does the released energy actually come from? Is it due to the fusion of whatever is inside a neutron star to whatever is inside of a black hole and\/or particles disintegrating into pure energy\/photons?\n\nSecondly, why does it come out of the poles? Is it because of the star's magnetic field? But given that photons are neutrally charged, why would the magnetic field matter?\n\nThirdly, say you have a neutron star just on the edge of it's upper mass limit and a small comet crashes into to, taking it over the edge and making it collapse.

{"title":"Nitinol shape memory effect vs superelasticity?","full_text":"Nitinol shape memory effect vs superelasticity? I recently came across Nitinol, an alloy that can exhibit two properties. What confuses me is the training of superelastic nitinol.\n\nSo, the first one, the shape memory effect, works by \"training\" the alloy at high temperatures (around 500\u2070C) into a shape it will \"remember\". So, later, at room temperature, it can be deformed into any other shape, but when heated (at about 75\u2070C), it will return to the shape it was trained into.\n\nThe second, superelasticity, causes the alloy to resist deformation at room temperature. It remembers the shape it was trained into, as opposed to being heated to recover. \nHow? How is this effect achieved at room temperature? Does the training temperature need to be lower or something?\nFrom what i read online it has something to do with the nickel-to-titanium ratio, but that's about where my understanding of this whole process ends.\n\n(Feel free to correct me if any of the information i mentioned is wrong!)\nCould someone explain the whole process better?

So in statistics I understand that, given a 1% chance of success, it will take an average of 68.something attempts to succeed, because the equation is .99^x = .5 and you solve for x.  However, does that mean that the average attempts to get, say, 1,000 successes at a 1% rate would be ~68,000?  On one hand, it makes sense that you would just multiply the average attempts by the number of successes necessary.  However, looking at it from the standpoint of common sense, a 1\/100 chance times 1,000 necessary successes should just be 100*1,000.  Which number is correct (if either) and why?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: for further clarification, I'm basically asking a question that's an extension of [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/explainlikeimfive\/comments\/25qsv7\/eli5_if_i_attempt_something_with_1_probability) old Reddit post.  If .99^100 = X and X is about .64, then you can just substitute X for number of attempts instead of probability and thus find the average number of attempts in order to have any given chance of success, correct?  That is, .99^x = .5, so x =68.9676.  This seems to assert that, after about 69 attempts, you would have a 50% chance of success.  So why doesn't that translate into chance of having a certain number of successes within a certain number of attempts?  Or why is this number not 100, since intuitively it should take an average of 100 attempts to succeed given a 1% chance of success? ","score":1.3862943611}

Sure, the occasional spontaneous mutation is needed as some sort of catalyst, speeding things up, and introducing radical changes that might turn out successful or not. But overall, mutations are by far not the main cause behind genetic modifications required for evolution - most of those are covered by standard genetic variation.\n\nNow, I'm wondering: How accurate is that intuitive understanding of mine?

So I've heard this many times before in the context of astronomy and JWST and I realized that I don't quite understand the implications of this statement: \"we perceive infrared as heat\". Our eyes see visible light frequencies, we have detectors that capture this visible light emitted from far away and our brains process it and that's how we see the environment around us. But about our perception of infrared as \"heat\":\n\n* Stars\/flames that burn hotter appear blue, stars that are colder appear red. Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes? Since infrared is heat and blue stars are hotter, I would expect more infrared from blue stars. Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red? Or is \"heat\" and \"hot temperature\" not actually the same thing in this case?\n* Our skin \"feels\" infrared as \"heat\". But does our skin only detect infrared by direct contact, so we have to be touching something to feel that it's \"hot\" and tense its temperature? Or does it also detect some infrared radiation going through vacuum\/air? When we feel the heat from a glowing red heater for example, do we feel the infrared radiation emitted directly by the hot metal, or do we feel the direct contact with the hot air that was heated by this nearby element and traveled to us across the room?\n* Infrared cameras see \"heat\" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat\/IR?\n* When our skin feels infrared, is it only sensitive to a certain part of the infrared spectrum? Does the infrared range our skin feels correspond to a small range of IR frequencies which correspond to a range of temperatures, that happen to be a \"safe\" range for our bodies to come in contact with? For example, when something feels \"very cold\" is that just a signal for our brain that any colder is dangerous, and what feels \"very hot\" tells our brain that any hotter is also dangerous?

An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \"aerial\" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.\n\nSigns of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.\n\nDetails on the discovery can be read here: https:\/\/www.eso.org\/public\/news\/eso2015\/\n\nWe are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery.

The tube would remain stationary, vertical, and partly submerged the whole time I pull the seal upwards. \n\nI'd imagine that pulling the airtight seal upward would create a vacuum under the seal that, as the seal rises, would draw in\/\"suck\" water into the tube from the vat.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING\n\nThis is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. \n\nBut Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. \n\nSo is force really mass x acceleration?

My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA! I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http:\/\/tiny.ucsf.edu\/7uNbjg\n\nMy lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. \n\nBy producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.\n\n\nI'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!\n\nEDIT: I am signing off now, thank you for all the thoughtful questions and comments! \n\n\n","score":8.8861326182}

Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.

{"title":"What is the technical difference between Cheek and Nasal PCR Covid tests?","full_text":"What is the technical difference between Cheek and Nasal PCR Covid tests? What are the technical difference(s) between the PCR Covid tests which use a sample from your cheek\/throat versus a shallow nasal swab? Are they generally interoperable? Is there a different solution (whatever I put the fancy q-tip in) or different fancy q-tip? What would happen if I took a throat\/cheek sample using a nasal kit?\n\nNear me (Los Angeles County, California) almost all of the PCR tests offered are the shallow nasal swabs. Those aren't super comfortable, and my children HATE them to the point of needing to restrain them to swab them. Works great at a drivethrough testing site, but less so at a walk up. I'm curious why testing centers overall haven't moved to the far easier to collect cheek swabs.","score":1.3862943611}
